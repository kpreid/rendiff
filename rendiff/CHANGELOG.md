### Breaking changes

TODO: Fill in this section

## 0.1.1 (2024-06-08)

### Added

* Difference images have been enhanced.
    * The expected input image is now displayed (in dark red) to give context for where the differences are.
    * The differences (now in cyan) are scaled up to make use of available dynamic range â€” small differences will be much more practical to view.
* `Threshold` may now contain entries of magnitude 255, which was previously rejected incorrectly.
* Expanded documentation, including further explanation of what applications `rendiff` is appropriate for, and example images.

### Removed

* Rust versions prior to 1.75.0 are no longer supported.

### Internal improvements

* No longer depends on the `itertools` package.

## 0.1.0 (2023-05-05)
